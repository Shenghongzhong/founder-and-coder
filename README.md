# Founder and Coder

## Overview

The aim of the repository is to organise all required projects for the application at Founder&Coder. However, the entire repository will contains all projects folders. Each project folders consists of code and relevant assets. This document contains vision and associated projects. 

## Vision

> Then God said, â€œLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground. - Gensis 1:26

> The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. - Gensis 2:15

As a Christian, I often think about the relationship and purpose between what I am doing and what God want to do with my life. As a God's image-bearer, what I create or what I can create is something God value. God put Adam in the Garden of Eden to work it. The "it" refers to the trees God planted. God wants to see how Adam will do with them. Either, Adam might put stones around the river of Pishon, or simply removed some trees from Garden.

As a data analyst/scientist, I often wrangle data a lot and the rest of my time is to build a dashboard in Excel. In other words, I don't have capability of creating products. Although I have tried to learn web development for many times, I couldn't make any progress. But I found my way to learn coding. Often, people ask me to do some developers' jobs. I always shake my head  and walk away. 

So what does it mean to do anything at Founder&Coder?

I went to their in-person info event last night and I realised my failure of learning web development was because of the lack of community. On the way back home, I remembered the goals that I wrote on napkin when I sat down with girlfriend last year on the boxing day. Of which, I wanted to complete a software engineering bootcamp. Not for the sake of getting a job but for fun. (Caususe I love my job and my work) 

Most importantly, I read an article from productivity guru. A single creative project that changes your life should be and will be always coming from free-will rather than external obligations. 

So learning web dev thing is more like to be creative as they are focuing on front-end development. How can I use my creativity to solve problems? How can I create my own technology?

## Projects

### Project 1 : Hobby Page

The difficult part of this project isn't technical but rather design perspective. My strategy is to analyse requirements first before I do any other things, although I have some basic HTML and CSS skills. I'm always stuck in the design part.

I guess many people will just rush to finish but my motivation of doing the application isn't FINISH. Because it's quite interesting and some requirements make me intrigued. For example, 

> *The page is visually interesting, for example with borders or colours*

What does it even mean? Visually interesting can be anything. I cooked cauliflower chickpeas potatoes curry for my girfriend and she said it could've been better with a bit more salt but to me the level of saltness was about right. Persoanlly, I don't understand how colour works. 

I just realised that there are so many design elements you need to think about. Shape, font, line, layout. In combination
